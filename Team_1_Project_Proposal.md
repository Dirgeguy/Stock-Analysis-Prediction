## Group 1 Project 2 Proposal: Stock Market Analysis & Prediction

### By Group Members: 
#### Diana, Eve, Peter & Bruno


Our project is to define an generalized predictive model for use in Stock trading.  We will use the LSTM model, a machine learning algorithm based on Recursive Neural Network (RNN) deep learning. We shall source our data, for training and trading, from yahoo financial APIs accessed through pandas_datareader. By reviewing correlation between expected returns compared with the standard deviations of the daily returns for the comparison stocks, we'll use these metrics to select the primary stock for our predictive lag-based LSTM Model.
